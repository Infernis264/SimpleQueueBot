# SimpleQueueBot
---
Creates a simple queue that can be interacted with using 6 commands:

---

## User commands

!join - joins the queue

!leave - leaves the queue

!queue - displays all users in the queue

---

## Mod commands

!draw - draws a random person from the queue

!startqueue - allows regular users to use queue commands

!stopqueue - disallows queue commands so chat will not get spammed with commands when the queue isn't open
